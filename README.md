# Santa Clara University's MSIS alumni have both highly sought-after technical skills and critical business skills. 

In the dashboard below, we can see that MSIS students learn valuable technical skills while also learning key business skills. These are the perfect blend that recruiters are looking for. When a MSIS student is hired, companies are able to lower training costs as he/she can start contributing immediately rather than going through weeks of intensive training. Companies are also able to take on new projects related to data analysis/mining since MSIS students learn Tableau, C and Java in their classes. This is critical as big data is becoming more than just a buzzword, it is becoming an issue that many companies are facing.
